# CarInDark

I have created a dark scene in the game by setting the provided Skybox asset as the main background. Additionally, I added a surface and a car to the scene, with the car model downloaded from the Asset Store.

The car's movement is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard, and the movement is implemented using physics. When the car moves forward, the front headlights turn on, and when it moves backward, the rear lights illuminate.

I also configured the Navigation tab to enable car movement by mouse click. During the car's movement, the front headlights remain lit. Upon starting the car, a designated sound plays, and when the car stops, a different sound is triggered.
